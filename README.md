# Customer-Churn-OTT-Prediction

This is a project I made along with my batchmates for the minor project in KIIT University

## About the project
Customer Churning is a serious problem for firms since it reduces revenue and stunts long-term development. As a result, anticipating and reducing customer churn has emerged as a key area for machine learning research. In this study, we investigate several machine learning models for forecasting customer churn rates. To identify the factors that affect customer churn, we first analyze a real-world dataset of an OTT provider. Then, in order to create prediction models, we preprocess the data, carry out exploratory data analysis, and use a variety of machine learning approaches, including logistic regression, decision trees, the LGBM Classifier, support vector machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier,XGBoost Classifier, Classification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models and various Bagging, Boosting Methods respectively and then we will generate the prediction results using evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate that, with an accuracy of 90%, the LGBM Classifier algorithm surpasses other algorithms in forecasting customer churn rates. We also pinpoint the key elements, such as gender, age, number of days subscribed, weekly minutes watched, videos watched, maximum inactive days, etc. Our study emphasizes the value of applying machine learning approaches to forecast customer churn rates, which may assist firms in identifying clients who are most likely to go and taking preventative steps to keep them.
